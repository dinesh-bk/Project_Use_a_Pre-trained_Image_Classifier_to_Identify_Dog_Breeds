# Project Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
The project involved utilizing a previously created image classifier to discern dog breeds, focusing on Python implementation rather than the development of the classifier itself.

Description:
The individual had volunteered to assist the organizing committee of a citywide dog show by aiding in contestant registration. Each participant registering for the event was required to submit an image of their dog along with relevant biographical information. The registration system utilized the provided biographical details to tag the submitted images.

There were concerns regarding individuals planning to register non-canine pets for the show.

The task required utilizing an existing Python classifier to verify that the registered participants indeed had dogs. The responsibility was to apply the Python tools learned to utilize the classifier effectively.

Note: The task did not involve creating the classifier, as it had already been provided. Instead, the focus was on applying Python tools to utilize the existing classifier.
